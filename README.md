# Introduction

I received my Ph.D degree from University Paris Dauphine in 2016, supervised by Prof.[Laurent D. Cohen](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cohen/).

I develop several new minimal path models for image segmentation and tubular structure extraction by designing suitable geodesic metrics and algorithms.
