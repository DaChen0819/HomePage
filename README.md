#Introduction

I received my Ph.D degree from University Paris Dauphine supervised by Prof.[Laurent D. Cohen](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cohen/) in 2016.

I develop several new minimal path models for image segmentation and tubular structure extraction by designing suitable geodesic metrics and algorithms.
